# ADC-and-DMA-interface

Contains code for interface of ADC and DMA on FRDM KL25Z.

The code involves:

 • Implementation of 16-bit single ended mode ADC and its configuration to enable DMA request.
 
 • Configuration of the DMA to transfer the incoming samples to a double buffer for efficient reading and writing of data.
 
 • Development of an application to perform peak level mentoring on the incoming ADC data for data analysis.
